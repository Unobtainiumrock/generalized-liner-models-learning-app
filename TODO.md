1. Add a set of endpoints about the inner workings of all the features avaialable from this application and provide them as context through prompt templating to the Chat feature, so that users can get highly specific context for navigating how to use the app. We can have direct mappings between questions and answers that execute application workflows for the user. This can give a chat-centric way for them to interact with the application

2. Make the above set up in a way such that these sets of tools are also exposed to potential web agents that visit the site or humans using agentic browsers to execute tasks. See if MCP or A2A is applicable here.

3. Document the system proposed in steps 1 and 2.

4. Verify the logical correctness of things like Knuth's algorithm for Poisson distributions.

5. Hook up the API logic for OpenAI API and ensure that we are securely storing API keys and environment variables.
